# Dare to give your junior developers permission to fail - Pending

## Abstract

In this talk, I will present several ways in which you can create an environment that promotes creativity and experimentation for junior developers. This is possible only if you create space for your junior developers to fail with dignity. If you are a junior developer yourself, your mission is to seek out environments that will encourage you to push your boundaries without equating failure with humiliation. This talk will focus on how to be a good mentor, and how to walk with your juniors instead of leading them by the ear, and the qualities you should seek if you are looking for a mentor.

## Details

This talk is aimed at junior developers and the patient heroes that mentor them. The main takeaway for mentors and senior developers is a better understanding, or gentle reminder, that they can help level up junior developers by getting out of their way and giving them the space to explore their ideas. For juniors, this talk will give them an insight into what a great mentor is, and what they should be looking for in a mentor.

Outline:

- Introduction
  - My journey from junior to where I am now after only 2 years of experience of Rails
  - Brief story about when my mentor, Nate Hopkins, gave me space to experiment and what an impact that had on my imposter syndrome and confidence
- Explain what kind of space juniors need to grow
  - Why failure is important
  - Fostering mutual respect and creating a safe space
  - Encouraging experimentation
- Benefits of creating an environment that encourages creativity
  - Mental health and burnout
  - Turning failures into teaching moments
  - Walking beside, instead of in front of, juniors
- Conclusion

## Pitch

The more experience you have, the further removed you are from the needs of your junior developers. With only two years experience, I have a fresh perspective on the positive and negative mentorship tactics that many juniors are currently being exposed to. The main premise behind this talk comes from a discussion I had with my team lead about a pattern I had introduced that others didn’t seem to like. The takeaway from that conversation is my lead wanted to give me the space to explore my ideas. If I succeeded, we would have a great new pattern to use moving forward. If I failed, it wasn’t something we couldn’t recover from, and I would have learned a great deal. The key to these two possible outcomes is that regardless of whether I succeeded or failed in my attempt, my mentor was excited to help me realize the lessons I learned from the experiment that would help me to become a better developer moving forward.

The other reason this talk should be considered is because juniors and mids need to see someone like them on the stage. I have been to two RailsConf’s and one RubyConf and took a lot out of the many talks I attended but none of them look like me. Most of the speakers are older, well respected Rubyists and it’s hard to justify taking the time to submit a talk when you think only talks from these more experienced developers will be accepted. By giving this talk, my hope is that I inspire other developers with similar experience to submit their conference talk ideas and continue growing the Ruby community.

#### Bio

Andrew Mason is a Ruby on Rails engineer at CodeFund. Throughout his relatively short career, he has focused on working and learning in the open to help junior developers know that they are not alone. Andrew is an active contributor to several open source projects such as Stimulus Reflex, and is a very active podcaster on shows like Remote Ruby and The Ruby Blend. Regardless of whether he is working CodeFund’s open source codebase, or appearing on a podcast, Andrew’s goal is to teach other’s through his failures, and to learn as much as he can from those around him. When Andrew is not programming, he is probably surfing, reading, or playing board games with friends.
